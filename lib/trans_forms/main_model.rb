      # This method will extend the BaseForm functionality with the

      #
      # The +model+ argument is a symbol in the underscore format
      # of a Class name, i.e. +:post+ or +:product_group+
      #
      # The +options+ argument is a Hash that can have the following
      # options set:
      #
      # +:proxy+
      #   With proxy defined, the method +model_name+, +to_key+ and
      #   +persisted?+ will refer to the main_model and main_instance
      #   instead of the Form Model.
      #
      #   class PostForm < TransForms::FormBase
      #     set_main_model :post, proxy: true
      #   end
      #
      #   You can also configure the proxy further by defining the
      #   +attributes+ option inside the proxy. If the value is +:all+
      #   then it will define all the columns of the main model. But
      #   you can also set the value to an array with the names of the
      #   columns you wish to proxy:
      #
      #   class PostForm < TransForms::FormBase
      #     set_main_model :post, proxy: { attributes: :all }
      #   end
      #
      #   class PostForm < TransForms::FormBase
      #     set_main_model :post, proxy: { attributes: %w(title body status) }
      #   end

        attr_accessor model

        # Implements proxy module that overwrites model_name method
        # to instead return an ActiveModel::Mame class for the
